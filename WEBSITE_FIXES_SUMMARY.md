# Website Issues Fixed - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Website Opens with 404 Page Instead of Home Page
**Root Cause:** Vite configuration was using the production base path in development mode.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to only use base path in production mode
- Added both `index` and `path="/"` routes in `App.tsx` for better routing
- Improved `NotFound.tsx` to handle root path redirects properly

### 2. Image Path 404 Errors
**Root Cause:** 
- Missing fallback handling for broken image links
- Some images might not exist or have incorrect paths

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced `getImagePath()` function in `imagePaths.ts` for better error handling
- Added proper image error handling to all image components in `Index.tsx`
- Created a fallback SVG image (`public/images/fallback.svg`)
- Updated all image elements to use consistent error handling

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Fixed base path for development mode
- `src/App.tsx` - Enhanced routing configuration
- `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` - Improved 404 handling and root redirects

### Image Handling
- `src/utils/imagePaths.ts` - Enhanced error handling and debugging
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Added consistent image error handling to all images
- `public/images/fallback.svg` - New fallback image for broken links

### Debugging Tools
- `debug-images-fixed.js` - Script to check which images exist and which are missing

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Image Paths
```bash
node debug-images-fixed.js
```

### 3. Expected Behavior
- Website should load directly to the home page at `http://localhost:5174/`
- No 404 page should appear by default
- Images that exist should load normally
- Missing images should show a placeholder instead of broken image icons
- Console should show debug information about any missing images

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting 404 Page by Default:
1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Check browser console for any routing errors
3. Verify no browser extensions are interfering

### If Images Still Show 404s:
1. Run `node debug-images-fixed.js` to see which images are missing
2. Check that image files exist in the correct `public/images/` subdirectories
3. Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
4. Check browser Network tab to see actual HTTP requests being made

### Port Issues:
- Development server should run on port 5174
- If port is busy, stop other development servers or use `npm run dev -- --port 5175`

## Next Steps

1. **Test the development server** - Start with `npm start` and verify home page loads at http://localhost:5174/
2. **Check image loading** - Look for any remaining broken images and fix file paths
3. **Test deployment** - Use `npm run enhanced-deploy` to deploy with fixes
4. **Verify production** - Check that both dev and production environments work correctly

## Key Changes Summary

✅ Fixed Vite config base path for development  
✅ Enhanced routing with proper index route handling  
✅ Added comprehensive image error handling  
✅ Created fallback images for missing files  
✅ Improved debugging tools for image paths  
✅ Enhanced NotFound page logic to prevent false 404s  

The website should now:
- Load the home page by default (not 404)
- Handle missing images gracefully with fallbacks
- Provide better debugging information for image issues
- Work consistently in both development and production modes
