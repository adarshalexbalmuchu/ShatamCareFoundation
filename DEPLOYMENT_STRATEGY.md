# GitHub Pages Deployment Strategy

## üíº Problem & Solution Overview

**Persistent Issues:**
The GitHub Pages deployment for this project has been inconsistently showing:

1. Resource Loading Issues:
   - 404 errors on assets
   - White screens
   - Missing images and resources
   - Requests to `/src/main.tsx` instead of built files
   
2. App.tsx 500 Error:
   - `App.tsx:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)`
   - This occurs when the server is trying to serve the App.tsx source file instead of the built JavaScript

**Root Cause:**
GitHub Pages is sometimes serving the development version of `index.html` with source references instead of the built files. This happens because the `gh-pages` deployment tool is not consistently:
- Cleaning up the target branch before deploying
- Properly limiting the deployment to only the `dist` folder contents
- Ensuring GitHub Pages does not process files with Jekyll

## üõ†Ô∏è Robust Deployment Strategy

### Option 1: Enhanced Clean Deployment (Recommended for App.tsx 500 Error)

We've created a specialized script that completely eliminates source file issues:

```bash
npm run enhanced-deploy
```

This script:

1. Cleans and rebuilds the dist folder
2. Verifies no source files are included in the dist folder
3. Creates a `.nojekyll` file and proper 404.html for SPA routing
4. Creates a completely separate, clean git repository in a temporary folder
5. Copies ONLY the built files to this clean repository
6. Force pushes this clean repository to the gh-pages branch
7. Cleans up temporary files

### Option 2: Standard Clean Deployment

Our original clean deployment script:

```bash
npm run clean-deploy
```

This script:

1. Cleans and rebuilds the dist folder
2. Creates a `.nojekyll` file
3. Deletes the remote gh-pages branch
4. Deploys only the dist folder contents

### Option 2: Manual Nuclear Fix

If the automated script fails, perform these steps manually:

```bash
# 1. Delete remote gh-pages branch
git push origin --delete gh-pages

# 2. Clean local gh-pages branch (if exists)
git branch -D gh-pages

# 3. Remove dist folder & node_modules/.cache/gh-pages
rm -rf dist
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/gh-pages

# 4. Rebuild project
npm run build

# 5. Create .nojekyll file
echo "" > dist/.nojekyll

# 6. Deploy only the dist folder
npx gh-pages -d dist --dotfiles
```

### Option 3: Last Resort - Manual Branch Creation

If both options above fail:

1. Delete the gh-pages branch
2. Create a new gh-pages branch from main
3. Remove all files except .git
4. Copy over ONLY the dist folder contents
5. Add a .nojekyll file
6. Commit and push

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D gh-pages
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
cp -r dist/* .
echo "" > .nojekyll
git add .
git commit -m "Manual deployment of built files only"
git push -f origin gh-pages
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After deployment:

1. Wait 5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
2. Open DevTools (F12) and go to Network tab
3. Load the site and verify:
   - No 404 errors
   - Requests go to proper assets (not source files)
   - Check that the index.html being served has minified content
   - No "App.tsx:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500" error
   - Check that source files (like App.tsx) aren't being requested

4. Additional App.tsx Error Checks:
   - If you see "App.tsx:1 Failed to load resource" errors, you need to use the enhanced-deploy option
   - This error means the deployment contains source files that shouldn't be there
   - When fixed properly, all requests should be to compiled JS files, not .tsx files

## üîç Ongoing Monitoring

After each deployment, check the GitHub Pages branch to ensure:

1. It contains ONLY the built files (from dist)
2. It has a `.nojekyll` file
3. There are no source code files (.tsx, etc.)
4. The index.html is the built/minified version

## üí° Prevention Tips

1. Always use `npm run clean-deploy` for deployment
2. Never modify the base path in vite.config.ts
3. Check GitHub Actions logs for any errors during deployment
4. Validate deployed content after each deployment
