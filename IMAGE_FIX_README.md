# Image Path Fix for GitHub Pages

## Problem
Images were not loading on GitHub Pages because the base URL was not correctly applied.

## Root Cause
1. The `getImagePath` function was creating double slashes in paths
2. The base URL was inconsistent between development and production
3. Some images in the list didn't match the actual files in the public directory

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed `getImagePath` function in `src/utils/imagePaths.ts`:
- Properly handles base URL for production vs development
- Removes leading slashes before combining with base URL
- Added debugging logs to track path generation

### 2. Updated `getBaseUrl` function in `src/utils/url-helpers.ts`:
- Consistent base URL handling
- Added debug logging
- Removed trailing slash to prevent double slashes

### 3. Updated available images list in `src/pages/ProgramsPage.tsx`:
- Added all missing images that were causing 404 errors
- Organized by category for better maintenance

### 4. Updated Vite config:
- Added explicit asset includes for image files
- Ensured proper base URL configuration

## Expected Result
- In development: Images load from `/images/...`
- In production: Images load from `/ShatamCareFoundation/images/...`
- All images in the error logs should now be accessible

## Test Locally
1. Run `npm run dev` - images should work in development
2. Run `npm run build && npm run preview` - images should work in production mode
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages - images should work on live site

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/imagePaths.ts`
- `src/utils/url-helpers.ts`
- `src/pages/ProgramsPage.tsx`
- `vite.config.ts`
