2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. Enable auto-deployment on push to main branch

### Option 2: Vercel

2. Framework preset: Vite
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Output directory: `dist`

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
1. Enable GitHub Actions workflow (already configured)
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
4. Your site will be available at your custom domain

### Option 4: Traditional Web Hosting
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload contents of `dist/` folder to your web server
3. Configure server to serve `index.html` for all routes

## Environment Variables (Backend Integration)
When you add backend functionality, create these environment variables:

```bash
# Production
VITE_API_URL=https://api.shatamcare.org
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production

# Development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## Server Configuration
For Single Page Application (SPA) routing, configure your server:

### Nginx
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Apache (.htaccess)
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

## Performance Monitoring
After deployment, monitor:
- Page load speeds (aim for < 3 seconds)
- Core Web Vitals scores
- Mobile responsiveness
- SEO rankings for key terms

## Backup Strategy
- Regular database backups (when backend is added)
- Version control with Git
- Automated deployment rollback capability

## Support
For deployment issues, contact your development team or refer to the hosting provider's documentation.
