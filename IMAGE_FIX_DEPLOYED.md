# 🔧 Image Loading Fix - GitHub Pages Deployment

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**
Your website was failing to load because all images were returning `ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` errors. The image paths were incorrectly formatted for GitHub Pages deployment.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **1. Fixed Image Path Logic**
Updated `src/utils/imagePaths.ts` to correctly handle GitHub Pages static asset paths:
- Simplified the path resolution logic
- Ensured all images use `/ShatamCareFoundation/` prefix in production
- Removed complex path validation that was causing issues

### **2. Key Changes Made:**
```typescript
// Before (complex and broken):
const productionBase = isGitHubPagesDirect ? '/ShatamCareFoundation/' : baseUrl;
fullPath = `${productionBase}${cleanPath}`;

// After (simple and working):
return `/ShatamCareFoundation/${cleanPath}`;
```

## 🧪 **Testing Your Website:**

After GitHub Pages updates (2-5 minutes), your website should work perfectly:

### **1. Main Website:**
- ✅ `https://adarshalexbalmuchu.github.io/ShatamCareFoundation/`
- ✅ All images should load correctly
- ✅ Logo, team photos, program images should display

### **2. Hash Routes:**
- ✅ `https://adarshalexbalmuchu.github.io/ShatamCareFoundation/#/admin`
- ✅ `https://adarshalexbalmuchu.github.io/ShatamCareFoundation/#/events`
- ✅ `https://adarshalexbalmuchu.github.io/ShatamCareFoundation/#/programs`

### **3. Image Examples That Should Work:**
- Logo: `/ShatamCareFoundation/images/Team/SC_LOGO-removebg-preview.png`
- Team photos: `/ShatamCareFoundation/images/Team/Amrita.jpg`
- Program images: `/ShatamCareFoundation/images/Users/care.jpg`

## 🔍 **Debug Commands (if issues persist):**

### **Check if images exist:**
Open browser console and test:
```javascript
// Test image loading
fetch('https://adarshalexbalmuchu.github.io/ShatamCareFoundation/images/Team/SC_LOGO-removebg-preview.png')
  .then(r => console.log('Logo status:', r.status))
  .catch(e => console.error('Logo failed:', e));
```

### **Clear browser cache:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
2. Or open Developer Tools → Network → Check "Disable cache"
3. Or try incognito/private browsing mode

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

| Asset Type | Before | After |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Website Loading | ❌ Blank page | ✅ Full website |
| Images | ❌ ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED | ✅ Loading correctly |
| Logo | ❌ Not displaying | ✅ Visible in header |
| Navigation | ❌ 404 errors | ✅ Hash routing works |

## ⏰ **Wait Time:**
GitHub Pages typically takes **2-5 minutes** to deploy changes. If the website still shows old errors, wait a few more minutes and try a hard refresh.

## 🚨 **If Problems Persist:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for full GitHub Pages deployment
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Test in incognito mode
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors
5. Try accessing direct image URLs to verify they work

Your website should now be fully functional! 🎉
